# starreckon

A local-only **developer wrapped** for AI-coding work. It reads the session logs
Claude Code, Claude Cowork and Codex already wrote on your disk and turns them
into a Porter-Grade skill star — live in the terminal while it scans, then as a
self-contained SVG card and a full HTML stats page. No account, no upload, no
server-side scoring. The thesis is not "trust us": **run it under OS confinement
and let the kernel answer.**

**Status:** published as **`starreckon`**, source at
`github.com/Alexander-Sorrell-IT/starreckon`. Zero dependencies.

```bash
npx starreckon                       # scan, with the live star
npx starreckon --yes --card --page   # no prompts; also write the SVG card + HTML page
git clone https://github.com/Alexander-Sorrell-IT/starreckon.git && cd starreckon
node src/cli.mjs                        # or read the source first, then run the tree you read
```

One real frame of the live star, rendered with colour disabled and the middle
rows elided — the whole 78×26 frame, verbatim, is under
[What you get](#what-you-get):

## Why this is not `npx standout`

`npx standout` reads the same local logs — and then **uploads** what it pulled
out of them to a remote service that scores you server-side. starreckon computes
the same class of signals **in this process, on your machine**, stores no
transcript text at all, pseudonymises your account identity in every file it
writes, and hands you an OS-level way to check all of that yourself.

Stated in two registers, because they have different kinds of backing:

**Checkable in this tree, right now.** `src/profile.mjs` computes the
judgment-signal metrics (correction rate, question ratio, prompt depth,
delegation, tool mix, concurrency) by reading prompt text *in-stream to
increment counters* and never storing it — no `exchanges`, no `prompt_samples`,
no `prompt_frequency`, no `conversation_samples`. Grep it; the privacy contract
is written at the top of the file, and `starreckon verify` re-reads the
output files afterwards looking for transcript-sized strings.

**Read from the standout CLI bundle (August 2026), so re-read it yourself
before quoting it — a vendor can change this at any release:** its payload caps
out around **4 MB**, and carries project paths, prompt samples, and up to
**500 full user/assistant exchange pairs**. Those field names are where
`src/profile.mjs` gets its metric lineage — the formulas were ported from that
bundle deliberately, so the comparison is like-for-like.

| | `npx standout` | starreckon |
|---|---|---|
| Where scoring happens | on their server, after an upload | in this process, on your machine |
| What travels | up to ~4 MB: project paths, prompt samples, up to 500 exchange pairs (per their bundle, Aug 2026) | nothing on the scan path; outputs are files under `~/.starreckon` until *you* move them |
| Transcript text | uploaded as samples/exchanges | never stored — counted in-stream, then dropped |
| Your identity in files | — (not a claim we make about their service) | `acct-<hash>` pseudonym in every file; the address stays on your terminal |
| How you check it | read their client; the scoring happens somewhere you can't watch | run it under a deny-network sandbox and read the kernel's answer |

A dash means we do not claim to know. This is a comparison of mechanisms, not
a swipe: standout's design is a reasonable one for a hosted product, and this
project ports its formulas on purpose. The difference is where the computation
happens and what you are able to verify.

## Prove it: the kernel refuses, and you can watch it happen

A no-egress claim that never *tries* to cross the wall proves nothing. So
`src/confine.mjs` ships a deliberate positive control — it really opens a TCP
connection to 1.1.1.1:443 — and you run it on both sides of the wall. Verbatim
output from this machine (macOS 15, Node 20):

```
# OUTSIDE the sandbox — proof the probe is a real network attempt:
$ node src/confine.mjs --probe
egress attempt: TCP 1.1.1.1:443 (timeout 3000ms)
result: NOT BLOCKED — connected to 1.1.1.1:443 — egress is OPEN in this context

# INSIDE the sandbox — the same attempt, refused below the JS layer:
$ sandbox-exec -p '(version 1)(allow default)(deny network*)' node src/confine.mjs --probe
egress attempt: TCP 1.1.1.1:443 (timeout 3000ms)
result: BLOCKED — EPERM on connect() — the kernel refused before any packet could leave (connect EPERM 1.1.1.1:443 - Local (0.0.0.0:0))
```

That contrast *is* the product. The errno in parentheses is the part that makes
it a kernel refusal rather than a story about one — a timeout is deliberately
**not** counted as blocked, because dropped packets may still have left the
machine.

```bash
sh bin/starreckon-proof.sh   # runs a real scan inside the deny-network sandbox,
                            # plus both control probes, and prints
                            # PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE
```

Nothing in that script trusts starreckon: it hands the question to the OS. On
Linux the same proof is `unshare -rn`. `node src/cli.mjs prove` prints the
profile and the exact command **without running anything**, so you can read the
proof before you trust it. [PROVE-IT.md](PROVE-IT.md) has the whole ladder,
strongest first, with what each rung does *not* prove.

## What you get

**A skill star that builds while it scans.** `src/star.mjs` redraws a five-axis
78×26 frame in place in the terminal every five files, so you watch the arms
grow as the logs are read. It is drawn as an image, not as character art: each
cell carries two pixels (the half-block `▀` painted in the foreground colour
over a background colour), the shape is supersampled for anti-aliasing, and
because a terminal cell is about twice as tall as it is wide those pixels come
out roughly square. Below is one whole frame, verbatim from `renderStar()` with
colour disabled — the colour version shades the same field through a 256-colour
ramp instead of the `░▒▓█` density ramp you see here. A test asserts this exact
block still matches the renderer, so the README cannot drift from the binary:

                     SKILL POINTS 23.0/35  scan complete
```

Redrawing in place needs a TTY. Piped or redirected, the frame is printed once
at the end instead of animating — same numbers, no cursor tricks.

**Two stars, not one.** The star that draws during the scan is *every log still
on disk* — roughly a month, because that is how long the logs are kept. The
second star is your **lifetime**, rebuilt from the monthly snapshots, and it is
the one that keeps growing after the logs are gone. A default run shows both.
They are deliberately different numbers; the labels under them say which is
which, and on a first run only one is drawn, since lifetime *is* this month and
a second copy would imply a comparison nothing measured.

**Star-only modes.** `--star` prints the lifetime star and nothing else — no
banner, no source tally, no summary, no cards, no QR, no menu, and no scan
animation above it. `--dual` prints two stars the same way: this month, then
lifetime. Both are for screenshots, pipes, and READMEs, where the other twenty
lines are in the way.

**The wrapped is the default.** `npx starreckon` scans and then tells the
story; `--no-wrapped` gives you the summary only, and `--no-pace` prints every
card at once instead of waiting for a keypress (which is also what happens
automatically when output is piped).

**Every run ends with a menu, not homework.** In a terminal you get:

```text
before you go
  [p] prove it   ask the kernel whether anything can leave
  [r] receipt    every field it KEPT, read from the bytes on disk
  [d] daemon     schedule monthly re-scans so history outlives the logs
  [q] done
```

`[p]` **runs** the proof, right there, in three steps:

```text
1/3 probe OUTSIDE the sandbox  → NOT BLOCKED — connected to 1.1.1.1:443
                                 control VALID — egress really is open here
2/3 the same probe INSIDE      → BLOCKED — EPERM on connect() — the kernel
                                 refused before any packet could leave
3/3 the scan itself, sealed    → completed
```

Step 1 is not decoration. A proof whose probe never connects proves nothing
about the wall, so the run has to show egress genuinely open on the outside
before "blocked" on the inside means anything. Both probes run in **child
processes**: the CLI arms a tripwire at startup, so an in-process probe could
never connect, and an earlier version of this reported that tripwire failure as
"connected" — a control that cannot succeed is not a control.

The menu says so on screen: this is starreckon running a check on starreckon, and
it is the **weaker** form. The strong one is unchanged and is yours to run:

```bash
sh bin/starreckon-proof.sh    # you run it, in your shell, where this tool gets no vote
starreckon prove          # prints the command without running anything
```

These are the same two questions as before, and you still need both — `prove`
for what LEFT, `receipt` for what was KEPT.

`receipt` is the half a no-egress claim does not cover. A tool that never opens
a socket can still read your whole transcript and park it in a file on your
disk, and **a scheduled run prints to a log nobody watches**, so "what you saw
in the terminal" cannot account for it. So the receipt walks `~/.starreckon` —
everything starreckon retains — and reports what is actually in there: every file
with its size and SHA-256, every field name (map-like objects collapsed to
`models.<key>` so the list shows *fields*, not your values), and **the longest
piece of free text in your stored data**, judged separately from rendered
report pages, which are mostly the tool's own labels. On this machine that
longest string is 279 characters and it is starreckon's own audit note. If it
were keeping your prompts, they would be there — a test plants a transcript in
the data dir and fails if the receipt does not surface it. `--json` emits the
whole pack. It reads only; a command that accounts for writes must not add to
the pile.

Then, optionally:

```bash
starreckon daemon on      # writes a schedule file, prints the load command
starreckon daemon status  # what is scheduled, and what it will run
starreckon daemon off     # removes it, prints the unload command
```

Logs age off disk after about 30 days, so a single run can only ever see one
month. The snapshots outlive the logs — but only if something takes them
regularly, which is all this schedules. **It does not install itself.** It writes
a plain-text schedule file, prints the one command that loads it, and stops. You
read the file before it is live, and the step that makes it live is a command you
typed. A tool whose pitch is "nothing leaves your machine" has no business
silently registering a background job that reads your disk every month, and a
test asserts that a plain scan never writes one.

**The cards.** Twelve boxed cards, one keypress at a time,
in the format everyone already recognises from a hosted wrapped: the shape of
your work, hours, history, tokens, the month-by-month
silhouette, when you code, how you drive the machine, how many agents you juggle,
tools and models, top projects, and a share card. Piped or `--no-pace`, the
whole story prints at once.

**The QR carries your results, not a link to them.** A hosted wrapped makes a
share code by uploading your numbers and encoding a URL that points at them —
the one thing this tool will not do. So the code below the last card *is* the
data:

```text
starreckon skill star 23.7/25 (S+)
firs 5 engi 5 codi 4.7 outs 5 tena 4
153 sessions, 344h active, 29 days
5.7B tokens, 99% cached
longest streak 16d
this code carries the numbers themselves, not a link to them.
https://github.com/Alexander-Sorrell-IT/starreckon
```

Scan it and your phone shows exactly that — the same numbers the terminal
showed, plus the repo. Nothing was published to make it scannable and no server
has to stay up for it to keep working. Decode it yourself and check.

The encoder is in this tree (`src/qr.mjs`, no dependency — a dependency is code
`verify` never scans and you never read). It prefers EC level M and drops to L
only when the payload will not otherwise fit, and it **refuses** rather than
truncating: a QR encoding half a URL scans perfectly and sends you somewhere
wrong. The block prints below the card rather than inside it, because a
version-10 symbol with its quiet zone is 61 columns against a 60-column card,
and a QR with a clipped quiet zone looks fine and does not scan.

Two differences from a hosted wrapped, and they are the point. **There is no
"top 17% of users" anywhere in it** — this tool has never seen anyone else's
data, so it benchmarks you against *your own months*, which you can check
against the snapshots on your disk. And the last card accounts for what left the
machine: nothing, plus the command that makes the kernel prove it rather than
asking you to believe it.

**There is no cost estimate, deliberately.** Earlier versions multiplied your
tokens by an assumed per-Mtok table and printed a dollar figure, labelled as an
assumption — which changes nothing, because a number with a currency sign on it
gets quoted as a price. The same model bills differently depending on the route
it was reached through, so one table cannot be right for a single person, let
alone across machines, and a tool that makes no network calls cannot know what
changed since it was written. Tokens are a fact the API returned; what they cost
is somebody else's number. A test fails the build if a currency figure reappears
in any module, report or page.

**The silhouette is the data.** Each arm's length is set by its own axis and by
nothing else, and the valleys between arms sit at a fixed radius — so a maxed
axis is a long spike, a weak one is a stub, and the outline is a fingerprint you
read before you read a number. A lopsided star says "here is the actual shape of
this person"; a symmetric one says "balanced generalist". The defect that broke
this was in the **notch, not the arms**: an earlier version placed each valley at
the average of its two neighbouring levels, so the notch between a 5 and a 1 sat
at exactly the same radius as the notch between two 3s, and the outline stopped
telling those two profiles apart at the place it should have separated them
most. (Arm tips always tracked their own level — an adversarial review corrected
an earlier draft of this paragraph that claimed otherwise, and the test named
below was rewritten because it pinned a property the *buggy* version also had.)
`tests/star.test.mjs` now pins both halves: every valley sits at the fixed radius
whatever the five levels are, and raising one axis must lengthen that arm while
provably leaving the other four where they were. Level 0 lands on the valley ring rather than at the centre, so
the star floors at a regular pentagon and the hull can never self-intersect,
whatever the five levels are. The geometry lives in one module
(`src/starsvg.mjs`) and is shared by the terminal frame, the card and the month
chips, so what you watch during the scan is the shape that lands on disk — also
a test.

**A star per snapshot.** Each monthly snapshot gets its own star, computed
*only* from that month's activity, written to `~/.starreckon/stars/YYYY-MM.svg`
(the most recent 36 months; the page strip shows the most recent 18 and says so)
and laid out as a strip on the stats page under "the shape over time". This is
the part a single lifetime-average star cannot show: the average is exactly what
hides a month where the shape changed. A thin month renders as a small tight
silhouette, not as a gap. To make that possible each snapshot carries its own
axis inputs (tool calls, language counts, project *count*, models, hour buckets,
active days, streak) — no path and no project name. All of them are counts
except the model ids, which are shape-checked and otherwise pseudonymised. What a
synced snapshot now discloses that it did not before is spelled out under
[what a report actually contains](#privacy-model);
"safe to sync" is your call to make with that list in front of you, not a
blanket claim this README gets to make for you. Where one month exists on more
than one machine the additive axes are summed, but **active days and streak take
the largest single machine's value, never the sum**: a calendar day you worked
on two laptops is one day, and two 4-day streaks are not an 8-day streak. The
day-sets themselves are not recoverable from the stored counts, so that axis is
reported as a floor rather than reconstructed.

**`--card` — a self-contained dark-HUD SVG.** 1280×720: a glowing pentagram web
with a reference ring per whole level, one node dot stepping out along each arm
per level it has actually reached, and a dashed all-fives outline behind the
hull so the gap between the two is the part not yet earned. The web and the
spokes are drawn at full extent, not at the current levels — the backdrop has to
hold still for the silhouette to be readable against it. Plus a letter RATING
(C / B / A / S / S+, off the skill total), a
SKILL OVERVIEW panel (total skill points, sessions, active hours) and an
ATTRIBUTES panel (tokens in+out, cache share, longest streak, active days,
velocity), footed `STARFORGE • LOCAL-ONLY SCAN • SECRETS REDACTED • PATHS
MASKED`. One file: system font names only, no webfonts, no scripts, and
nothing fetched when it renders — the only URL in the whole file is the SVG
namespace declaration. Open it in a browser or drop it straight into a README.
It lands in `~/.starreckon/reports/star-<date>.svg`.

**`--page` — a full local HTML stats page.** That same SVG embedded inline as
the hero, plus panels for JUDGMENT SIGNALS, RHYTHM, TOKEN ECONOMICS, TOOLS &
MODELS, CRAFT and RECORDS — and ACCOUNTS / FLEET / PROVIDERS as well when the
run produced them (`--accounts`, `--fleet`, the multi-CLI scan). Rendered on
your machine, written to `~/.starreckon/reports/stats-<date>.html`; like the
card, it references nothing remote. Read it before you share it — see "What a
report actually contains" below for exactly what is in there.

## Install

The package is `starreckon` on npm — `npx starreckon` is this tool.
`npx starreckon` fetches from the registry; [PROVE-IT.md](PROVE-IT.md) §5 is
the recipe for checking the fetched tarball matches the tree you grepped.

## Usage

```bash
starreckon                  # node src/cli.mjs        interactive: prompts for exclusions, live star
starreckon --yes            # node src/cli.mjs --yes   no prompts (excludes nothing)
starreckon --star           # ONLY the lifetime star — no summary, cards, QR or menu
starreckon --dual           # ONLY two stars: this month, then lifetime
starreckon --card           # write the Porter-Grade SVG card
starreckon --page           # write the full HTML stats page (runs the deeper profile pass)
starreckon --json           # write both a compact baseline and the full expanded JSON report
starreckon --sessions       # write the per-session export: one record per session, its four
                               # token counters kept apart, plus start/end, CLI and project.
                               # For comparing against another counter session by session —
                               # a grand-total check survives a swap between two sessions.
                               # Obeys --no-projects; project names are readable without it.
starreckon --profile        # run the deeper profile pass without writing the HTML page
                               # (it lands in the expanded JSON report)
starreckon --accounts       # per-account split + floor (files get acct-<hash>, not addresses)
starreckon --no-projects    # write proj-<hash> into the files instead of project names
starreckon --show-accounts  # opt in: write the RAW account email addresses into the files
starreckon --no-providers   # skip the multi-CLI scan (Gemini/Copilot/…)
starreckon --no-snapshot    # don't touch ~/.starreckon/snapshots or ~/.starreckon/stars

```

An unknown flag exits 2 and reads nothing: `--no-project` (singular) used to be
ignored in silence while the run wrote every real project name, so flags now
fail closed rather than open. Same for an unknown subcommand.

### Companion tools — `starreckon addons`

Four pip tools (`cli-wikia`, `cli-enforcement`, `cli-fleet`, `cli-collective`)
and two MCP servers (`filelens-mcp`, `sitemap-mcp`) are optional companions,
unlocked by a licence file at `~/.starreckon/licence.json`.

**The licence is checked offline.** It is an Ed25519 signature verified against
a public key compiled into `src/addons.mjs` — there is no activation call, no
licence server, and no request of any kind when a licence is missing, expired
or forged. That was the requirement rather than a convenience: the no-egress
proof is the most valuable thing this program has, and an entitlement check is
not worth spending it on. `starreckon addons` adds nothing to the write list in
[PROVE-IT.md](PROVE-IT.md) §6 either — it reads, and never writes.

`addons` reports five states, and they are deliberately not collapsed:

| | |
|---|---|
| `locked` | not covered by this licence. **Nothing was looked for** — an unlicensed install does not inventory your machine |
| `absent` | covered, and no such executable is on PATH |
| `unreachable` | covered, on PATH, and what PATH points at cannot be read — an editable install whose drive is unplugged looks exactly like this, and calling it `absent` would tell you to reinstall a tool you already own |
| `ready` | covered, installed, runnable |
| `external` | covered and installed, and starreckon will not run it |

`external` is a boundary, not a lesser tier. `sitemap-mcp` fetches live sites by
design, and both MCP servers are meant to be spawned over stdio by an MCP
client. starreckon lists them and never executes them, so the tools stay yours
and this program stays provably silent.

Because the pip tools live in a virtualenv, they are only on PATH when that
environment is active — so `addons` prints how many PATH entries it searched
rather than leaving `absent` looking definitive.

`--join-fleet` is the one flag that deliberately writes outside
`~/.starreckon`: it exists to merge several machines' totals, and if you point
it at a synced folder, those files sync. That is egress, by design and under
your control — [PROVE-IT.md](PROVE-IT.md) §6.

## What it does

| Area | What starreckon does |
|---|---|
| **Credential redaction** | 24 secret regexes (SSH keys, PEM blocks, provider tokens, JWTs, connection-string passwords, 32-byte hex keys, RFC1918 addresses) **plus** labeled-assignment and `ENV_VAR=value` detection — 26 matchers in all, applied *before* anything is stored or written |
| **Path masking** | Home directory, username, and deep local paths masked everywhere — including the mangled `-Users-you-Projects-…` form Claude Code writes; projects reduced to two-segment labels |
| **Identity pseudonymisation** | Your Claude OAuth **email address** never reaches a file: reports, the stats page and a `--join-fleet` folder carry a stable `acct-<hash>` label instead (the terminal still shows the address). `--show-accounts` opts into raw addresses — see "What a report actually contains" below for the honest limit |
| **Interactive exclusion** | Asks before scanning which folders/topics to exclude entirely. `--yes` skips the prompt; so does a non-TTY stdin (a pipe, CI) — and in that case the run prints that it was skipped and that nothing was excluded, rather than letting you believe you were asked |
| **Metadata over transcripts** | Reads the low-level token-usage records (deduped by message id) and session metadata — it never stores prompt text or conversation content at all |
| **Multi-account / multi-machine** | `--roots` merges log stores from other home directories; the snapshot dir is designed to be synced between machines and merges per-month per-host |
| **Rolling snapshots** | Every run (unless you pass `--no-snapshot`) updates `~/.starreckon/snapshots/YYYY-MM.json` — your history survives the ~30-day retention of the raw logs. Each snapshot carries its own axis inputs as **counts only** (no paths, no project names), which is what lets it draw its own star |
| **A star per month** | The same run writes `~/.starreckon/stars/YYYY-MM.svg`, one silhouette per snapshot, each computed only from that month — the strip on the stats page is the shape changing over time, which the lifetime average hides |
| **Velocity tracking** | Month-over-month deltas + linear trend across every snapshot |
| **Open & verifiable** | Small, dependency-free, readable source. The only network code in this tree is one deliberate outbound probe in `src/confine.mjs` that exists to be refused, plus `src/tripwire.mjs` importing network modules only to disarm them — everything else is checked mechanically by `starreckon verify`, and [PROVE-IT.md](PROVE-IT.md) shows what that does and doesn't cover |
| **Tamper-evident run log** | Every run writes `~/.starreckon/audit/run-<timestamp>.json`: what was read, what was written **through the audited path** (masked path + sha256 + bytes — a `--join-fleet` dir is written outside it, and each log's `writes_scope` field says so), the sha256 of every source file that ran, redacted argv, any tripwire hits, the confinement mode the run *claims* (`verified: false` — any process can set it), a monotonic `run_index` mirrored in a counter kept outside the audit dir, and the previous log's hash — a chain `verify` re-walks. Tamper-*evident*, not tamper-*proof*: PROVE-IT.md §4 states the limit plainly |

## The five axes

| Axis | Fed by |
|---|---|
| FIRST PRINCIPLES | total tokens exchanged (depth of work) |
| ENGINEERING | distinct projects + languages (breadth) |
| CODING | tool calls executed (volume) |
| OUTSIDE THE BOX | model diversity + late-night activity (events at 00:00–05:59, **counted**, not as a share of the day) |
| TENACITY | streaks + active days (consistency) |

Every axis is **monotonic**: more of its input can only lengthen its arm, never
shorten it. That is not decoration — late-night activity used to be scored as a
*share* of the day, so every daytime event shrank the OUTSIDE THE BOX arm and you
could watch it collapse mid-scan while starreckon was still finding your work. An
axis whose arm answers to another axis's input is not an axis. `tests/star.test.mjs`
now fails if raising any input shortens any arm.

Day and hour are both read on your **local** clock. They disagreed once — hours
local, day boundaries UTC — which made an evening session in a US timezone count
as two active days with no midnight anywhere in its own hour histogram, and made
the whole star a function of `$TZ`.

## Privacy model

Two claims that sound alike but need different proof — we keep them separate:

1. **"This source tree contains no network code except one probe that exists
   to be refused."** This one is checkable text: grep it, or run
   `starreckon verify`, which scans every file this package *publishes* —
   the JS, the shell script, `package.json` — for network/process APIs and
   fails on any hit outside two allowlisted safety files
   (`src/tripwire.mjs`, which imports network modules only to disarm them, and
   `src/confine.mjs`, the sandbox launcher and positive-control probe — that
   probe is real, it really connects, and that is the point). Being on the
   allowlist is not a blank cheque: those two files are held to five further
   rules — a SHA-256 content pin (an edit to either fails the check), their
   disarm/launch code still being present (keeping the imports is not enough),
   every hit staying inside a per-file list of permitted APIs, no egress
   destination named other than the probe's own hardcoded target, and *zero*
   hits failing too, because zero means the safety code was gutted.
   Shipped **test** files are enumerated but deliberately not judged — a
   scanner's own test suite has to contain the strings it hunts — and the
   check prints that list rather than hiding it. It's a claim about *this
   repo* — CI can enforce it — but note that `npx` runs the published tarball,
   not the tree you grepped; PROVE-IT.md §5 has the recipe to diff them.
2. **"Nothing left your machine at runtime."** No grep and no in-process check
   can prove this — worker threads, spawned processes, and low-level bindings
   all live below what a source scan or a JS-level tripwire can see. The only
   real proof is OS-level confinement: run starreckon under macOS `sandbox-exec`
   with a deny-network profile, or a Linux network namespace (`unshare -rn`),
   and the kernel refuses any outbound connection — including the built-in
   positive control quoted at the top of this page. PROVE-IT.md §1 has the
   exact commands; `sh bin/starreckon-proof.sh` runs them for you.

Also true, and worth knowing:

- Raw logs are read as streams; only aggregates survive — starreckon never
  stores prompt or conversation text. The `verify` output-scrub check re-reads
  every file under `~/.starreckon`, at any depth and whatever the extension,
  looking for transcript-sized strings, secrets, email addresses and your
  literal username — and prints the exact scope it covered, including what it
  declined to read and why. Read that printed line rather than trusting this
  one: it is a scan of starreckon's own data directory, not of your disk, and it
  is a heuristic, not a guarantee.
- Every string that could carry a path or secret passes through
  `src/redact.mjs` before it reaches memory structures that get written out.
- **What a report actually contains.** Paths are masked and secrets redacted,
  but "masked paths only" was never the whole truth, so here is the list: your
  **project names** (the last two segments of each working directory, e.g.
  `Clients/acme-audit`), this **machine's hostname** (in every snapshot and in the
  timeline), and — with `--accounts`/`--join-fleet` — one `acct-<hash>` label
  per Claude account. That is a de-identified list of *what you work on and
  where*.

  Since monthly snapshots started drawing their own stars they also carry, per
  month and per machine: a **24-bucket local-hour histogram**, the **model ids**
  you used, and a **project count**. None of those is a path or a name, but be
  clear-eyed about what a synced snapshot dir now shows a reader — the hour
  histogram is a work/sleep schedule keyed to a named machine, tracked month over
  month, and the project count is exactly the scope number `--no-projects` users
  are trying not to publish. Model ids are shape-checked before they are stored
  (letters, digits, `.` `:` `-`, 64 chars max); anything else becomes a
  `proj-<hash>` pseudonym, because that field is copied out of a log file and
  `--roots` can point the scanner at somebody else's logs.

  Two switches, and one thing you cannot switch off:
  - `--no-projects` writes `proj-<hash>` instead of every project label, in the
    reports, the stats page and a `--join-fleet` folder. The terminal keeps
    showing the real names.
  - the exclusion prompt drops folders from the scan entirely — but `--yes`
    skips the prompt and excludes nothing, and the PROVE-IT.md proof command
    passes `--yes`.
  - the **hostname** has no switch: snapshots are keyed on it so histories from
    several machines merge, and on a home network it usually carries the
    router-assigned domain too (`<laptop>.<isp-domain>`), which names your ISP.
    If that matters, don't sync `~/.starreckon/snapshots`.

  Read a report before you share it. `starreckon verify` prints this same
  list under the output-scrub check.
- **Account identities are pseudonyms by default.** The identity starreckon
  reads is your Claude OAuth **email address**. It is printed in the terminal,
  but files — reports, the HTML stats page, a `--join-fleet` folder — get
  `acct-<8 hex>` instead: a constant-salted SHA-256 prefix, stable across
  machines so per-account totals still merge. Honest limit: that hides your
  address from someone *reading* the file, but it cannot stop someone who
  already suspects an address from *confirming* it by hashing their guess. It
  is de-identification, not anonymity. `--show-accounts` writes the real
  addresses on purpose — and `verify` then fails until those files are gone.
- Syncing **is** the one way starreckon output leaves your machine, and
  pointing `--join-fleet` at a synced or network-mounted folder ships those
  files by design. No socket check can see that; PROVE-IT.md §6 spells it out.

## How the counting itself is tested

The privacy proofs above cover what leaves the machine. The counting is proven
separately, and more harshly than a test suite alone can:

- **1,000+ tests**, every one of which follows the house rule that a test is
  only believed after its fault has been planted and the failure watched.
- **A second, independent implementation.** The same counting rules exist in
  Python (`deadreckon`), and the two are run against each other. On the machine
  this was written on, the two programs scanned the same home and agreed **to
  the token** on every CLI — the one delta was the live session writing between
  the two scans.
- **A claims census** (`claims_probe.mjs`): every absolute sentence in the
  source — NEVER, ALWAYS, CANNOT, MUST — is falsified in a throwaway copy and
  must make a suite go red. A baseline runs before every mutation so a broken
  sandbox cannot report a false pass.
- **Mutation testing on every counting file** (`scan.mjs`, `scanners.mjs`,
  `readers.mjs`, `accounts.mjs`), with the bar set where it means something:
  every surviving mutation that can change a *number* is killed or written
  down as equivalent. A changed string in a display path is noise; a flipped
  `+=` in an accumulator is the product breaking.
- **Coverage-guided fuzzing of the readers** (jazzer.js): the contract fuzzed
  is that a reader never throws and never returns a shape its callers cannot
  use — calibrated by planting a known fault and watching it found in seconds.
- **The package, not just the source**: `npm pack` + install into an empty
  directory + run, because a test suite runs the source tree and a user
  installs the tarball — which are not the same thing, and were once broken
  apart for a full day while every test stayed green.

## Prove it (the long version)

Don't take this README's word for any of the above. [PROVE-IT.md](PROVE-IT.md)
is the step-by-step verification guide, strongest proof first: the one-command
scripted proof (`sh bin/starreckon-proof.sh`), OS confinement with a
kernel-refused positive control, what each `starreckon verify` check does
and does not cover, watching the process from outside with `lsof`/`nettop`/
`tcpdump`, the tamper-evident audit log and its honest limits, checking the npm
tarball against this repo, and the filesystem-egress caveat.
