// The consent screen for the optional layers — models, daemon, or both.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE, AND WHY IT ONLY RETURNS STRINGS
//
// The screen is reached two ways: a FLAG (`--with-models`, `--with-daemon`,
// `--with-both`) and a BUTTON in the before-you-go menu ([I], [D], [A]). The
// author's requirement is that those are the SAME screen, not two texts that
// happen to agree today. Two renderings of one promise are two things that will
// drift, and this repo has the scar tissue for exactly that shape of bug (see
// the COPY_DIRS divergence and the double-counted floor in the sibling project).
// So there is one renderer, both entry points call it, and a test reads the
// text through this module rather than through a screenshot of the CLI.
//
// It does no I/O of any kind: no fs, no child_process, no network. It builds
// strings and classifies an answer. That keeps it off `verify`'s static-scan
// allowlist entirely — a file that cannot spawn or connect needs no exemption,
// and adding one would have meant a new pin and a new promise to keep.
//
// WHAT THE SCREEN MUST SAY (author ruling, SPEC-optional-layers.md §7)
//   1. WHAT is about to happen, named for the door taken.
//   2. THAT A LOG FILE WILL BE SAVED — for every door, daemon-only included.
//   3. WHERE it runs and writes: locally, in this machine's own folder.
//   4. That it is NOT required, and skipping it makes nothing else wrong.
//
// EXACTLY TWO ANSWERS. An earlier draft had three — agree / do not agree / use
// without — and the author struck the middle one as invented: the question is
// only ever "do you want this optional layer?", so declining IS using without
// it. Offering both makes the reader choose between synonyms and wonder what
// they missed. Neither answer is a dead end; the scan runs either way.

// The download figure printed on the models door. It is the same "~600 MB" the
// [I] button and `search --search-setup` have always quoted — approximate, and
// the model publisher's, not a measurement taken here. It lives in a named
// constant so the consent screen and any future re-wording move together.
export const MODELS_SIZE = "~600 MB";

// Where a layer's log goes. NOT A GLOBAL PILE: the spec's phrase is "saved
// inside of that computer's folder", organised year / month / day, so that a
// ledger exists at every level of the architecture rather than only at the leaf.
//
// This constant is the promise the screen makes. src/layerlog.mjs is what keeps
// it, and tests/layerlog.test.mjs parses THIS STRING and requires the path the
// writer actually produces to match it — so the sentence and the bytes cannot
// drift apart without a test failing. The shape lives here, on the screen side,
// because consent.mjs must do no I/O (see the header) and importing the writer
// would drag node:fs into a file whose whole value is not having it.

// unsupported or already installed; [A] — "models AND daemon in ONE press" —
// printed unconditionally, and the `both` screen announced "about to WRITE THE
// SCHEDULE FILES" on every platform. On a machine with no schedule format the
// reader was told the files were coming, answered "agree", and none were
// written. The same shape was live on the models half: a reader whose venv was
// already on disk was quoted a ~600 MB download that could not happen.
//
// A screen that announces work it cannot do is precisely the failure a consent
// screen exists to prevent, so the promise is conditioned on measured state.
//
// WHY THE STATES ARE PASSED IN. This module does no I/O — that is the whole
// reason it stays off verify's static-scan allowlist (see the header). It
// cannot look at the disk to find out whether a venv exists or a plist is
// written, so the caller measures and passes the answer down. That also makes
// every state testable without owning the machine it describes.
//
// WHY THE MENU RULE LIVES HERE TOO. `offeredDoors` is the same question one
// step earlier — which buttons to print. Keeping the rule beside the text it
// gates is what stops the two from drifting, which is the bug this whole file
// was written to avoid, and it is the exact way [A] came apart from [D].

// ── WHERE THE PROMISE IS KEPT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The screen promises a log file. Three things had to land for that sentence to
// be true, and all three are in the tree now:
//
//   1. the writer — src/layerlog.mjs. One immutable record per layer run under
//      LOG_DIR_SHAPE, resolved against the real home (it handles the literal-"~"
//      $HOME that snapshots.mjs:20-27 records an npx run dying on).
//   2. the callers — src/search.mjs's runSearch() records every MODEL run, and
//      src/cli.mjs arms a record for every SCHEDULED daemon run above the
//      subcommand dispatch, since a scheduled run is precisely the run with no
//      terminal to account for it. The schedule files carry the marker that
//      says which job they are (src/daemon.mjs, STARRECKON_LAYER_RUN).
//   3. the reader — src/receipt.mjs surfaces the tree, so the log appears in
//      the list of what this program has KEPT about you.
//
// The per-level ledger is a VIEW recomputed from the run records on every
// write, never a second counter — two counters that must agree are two counters
// that will disagree. The cheap check that it stayed one: delete every
// ledger.json in the tree and the next layer run must rebuild them identically.
//
// What is still open, and is the author's to answer (SPEC-optional-layers.md
// §6): whether a MODEL record should carry the full three-statement protocol
// (your claim / the model's band / the outcome) rather than the run's shape
// alone. Today it carries the run.
