// The log the consent screen promises, and the ledger that reads it back.
//
// WHAT THIS PAYS OFF
//
// src/consent.mjs prints, before any optional layer starts:
//
//     a log file will be saved
//       every run of this layer will write one, under
//       ~/.starreckon/logs/<year>/<month>/<day>/ — inside THIS machine's own
//       folder, by year / month / day.
//
// Until this file existed that was a debt: the screen said it, nothing did it.
// consent.mjs owns the SENTENCE (it must stay free of fs — see its header) and
// this file owns the BYTES. The two are bound by a test, not by hope:
// tests/layerlog.test.mjs parses consent.LOG_DIR_SHAPE and requires the path
// this module actually writes to match it. Change either one alone and that
// test fails, which is the only arrangement in which a promise and its keeper
// cannot drift.
//
// TWO KINDS OF FILE, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS A FACT
//
//   a RUN RECORD   logs/YYYY/MM/DD/<time>-<layer>-<event>-<pid>-<rand>.json
//                  One per run of an optional layer. Written once, never
//                  reopened, never edited. This is the truth.
//
//   a LEDGER       logs/ledger.json, logs/YYYY/ledger.json,
//                  logs/YYYY/MM/ledger.json, logs/YYYY/MM/DD/ledger.json
//                  A VIEW of the run records beneath it. Recomputed in full,
//                  from the records, every time it is written.
//
// THE LEDGER IS NEVER A COUNTER. This is the author's explicit rule and it is
// the one thing in this file that must not be "optimised" later: there is no
// `+= 1` anywhere below, no stored subtotal that a later run adds to, and no
// level that derives from another level's ledger. Every level re-reads the leaf
// records. The reason is measured, not theoretical — this project has already
// shipped a second counter that inflated a number 2.71x (src/accounts.mjs:443,
// which summed rows a dedup should have collapsed), and a stored floor that
// froze 16,636 sessions against a true 132 (src/snapshots.mjs, quoted in
// src/ledger.mjs:116). Two numbers that must agree are two numbers that will
// disagree, and the one that is wrong is always the one nobody can recompute.
//
// The practical test of the rule: delete every ledger.json in the tree. The
// next run must rebuild them all identically. If that is ever not true, the
// ledger has become a counter and this file has failed its job.
//
// WHICH RUNS LAND HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT "ALL OF THEM"
//
//   the models layer — EVERY invocation, scheduled or typed. The layer exists
//       only because someone agreed to the screen, so every use of it is a use
//       of the thing they agreed to. Hooked inside search.mjs's runSearch(),
//       which is the single door every model call goes through.
//   the daemon layer — every SCHEDULED run. The daemon layer IS the schedule;
//       a `starreckon protect` a user types and watches is a foreground command
//       whose account is the terminal it printed to. Writing a file for it would
//       mean writing files for people who never turned any layer on, which is
//       the opposite of the bargain the screen struck.
//
// A scheduled run identifies itself with STARRECKON_LAYER_RUN, set by the
// schedule files daemon.mjs writes. It is a claim, not evidence — anyone can
// export it — and the record says so in its own `trigger_claimed_by` field
// rather than presenting it as a measurement.
//
// MASKING — DECIDED, NOT INHERITED
//
// This program masks before it writes, in four layers (src/redact.mjs):
// redactSecrets (25+ credential patterns), maskPath (home, username),
// accountPseudonym (identities), maskProjects (project names, under
// --no-projects). Which of them apply HERE:
//
//   redactSecrets + maskPath — YES, unconditionally, to every string that goes
//       into a record. maskText() is both, and it is applied at the boundary in
//       detailOf() so a future caller cannot forget it. src/audit.mjs:133 does
//       exactly this to argv for exactly this reason: a path or a flag value is
//       where the home directory and the username get in.
//
//   accountPseudonym — NOT APPLIED, because no identity is collected. A record
//       describes a RUN (which layer, when, how long, what came back), never a
//       user. There is nothing here to pseudonymise, and the way to keep that
//       true is to not have the field.
//
//   maskProjects — the same answer for a sharper reason. Project names are kept
//       readable BY DEFAULT in reports (src/redact.mjs:181) because a report is
//       most of the product; that trade was made for a file the user asks for
//       and reads. It is the wrong trade for a file written unattended by a
//       scheduled job. So no project label is recorded at all.
//
//   the search QUERY is the case worth naming. It is the user's own words about
//       their own code, and it is exactly what `starreckon receipt` exists to
//       prove this tool does not keep — receipt flags stored prose over 400
//       chars (src/receipt.mjs:33) and it walks this tree, so storing a query
//       here would make the tool's own disclosure command point at the tool.
//       A record therefore carries the query's LENGTH and a salted-free sha256
//       prefix, which answers "was this the same search as yesterday?" without
//       keeping the search. Auditing a layer needs to know a search ran, not
//       what was asked.
//
// CONCURRENCY
//
// The 6-hour protect tick and a person at a terminal can write in the same
// second; on the 1st of a month the monthly scan can join them. Two mechanisms,
// because the two kinds of file have opposite problems:
//
//   run records  — never share a file, and a record is NEVER overwritten. The
//       name carries the time to the millisecond, the pid and 2 random bytes,
//       so two PROCESSES cannot collide at all; the only remaining case is one
//       process writing twice in the same millisecond and drawing the same
//       bytes, and that draws again rather than replacing what is there. The
//       placement uses link(2), which is atomic AND fails on an existing name,
//       so there is no check-then-write window either. No lock is needed to
//       record the truth, which is the property that matters: whatever else
//       fails, the record lands, and it never lands on top of another one.
//       (fleet.mjs:628 is the counter-example in this repo: mkdir -p then
//       writeFileSync, no existence check, so a second write silently replaces
//       a machine's totals. Not a pattern to inherit one directory over.)
//
//   ledgers      — one writer at a time, via an O_EXCL-equivalent lock
//       (mkdir is atomic on every platform this runs on). Without it two runs
//       could each walk the tree and the slower one's write would erase the
//       faster one's, and the tree would look one run short until the next run
//       fixed it. A lock that cannot be taken is NOT an error and never blocks
//       a run: the record is already on disk, so the next successful run
//       rebuilds the view. src/audit.mjs:59 records the same race in the audit
//       dir as a known limit; here it is a lock and a self-healing view.
//
// THE CLOCK
//
// The directory is the LOCAL calendar date, because the tree is a person's
// index of their own machine and "what ran on Tuesday" means their Tuesday.
// The record also carries `at` (UTC instant) and `tz_offset_minutes`, so the
// ordering is never ambiguous even across a timezone change or a DST fold.
// audit.mjs stamps UTC only; that is right for a hash chain and wrong for a
// folder someone opens, and the difference is why both are written here.
