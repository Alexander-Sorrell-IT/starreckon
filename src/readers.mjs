/**
 * Sessions whose TRANSCRIPT IS GONE and whose counters survived.
 *
 * Claude Code's `cleanupPeriodDays` sweep deletes `projects/**´/*.jsonl` and
 * does not clear `projects.<cwd>.lastTotal*Tokens`, so for a deleted session
 * those counters are the only record that it ever happened. On the machine this
 * was ported from they account for 4,172,332,033 tokens across 78 sessions that
 * nothing else in either program can see.
 *
 * THREE TRAPS, ALL OF WHICH PRODUCE A CONFIDENT WRONG NUMBER:
 *
 * 1. `lastModelUsage` RESTATES `lastTotal*` per model. Verified on a real
 *    entry: 600278 + 61304 + 19044 = 680626 = lastTotalInputTokens exactly.
 *    Reading both is a clean 2x. Only the lastTotal* fields are summed here.
 *
 * 2. The same session appears in MANY config files — the live one, its
 *    backups, and the archive's copies. Summing per file gave 759,975,256,912
 *    against a true 4,172,332,033: 182 times over. Records are merged per
 *    session id by per-field MAXIMUM, never added.
 *
 * 3. The same FILE is reachable by more than one glob, and through hard links
 *    in the archive. Files are deduplicated by (device, inode) before anything
 *    is read.
 *
 * `known` is the set of session ids the ordinary Claude reader already
 * emitted. It is a REQUIRED argument rather than an optional one: defaulting
 * it to empty would mean a caller who forgets it silently counts every live
 * session twice, and that is the kind of default that reads as working.

 * entry per prompt with a session id, a timestamp and a project, and it holds
 * no usage counters of any kind. It cannot say what a lost session cost and it
 * must never be asked to: a port that gave it token fields would be describing
 * a file that does not have them, and the fields would read as measurements.
 *
 * What it gives instead is proof that a session EXISTED, when, and in which
 * project. Transcripts are deleted on a timer; this is not, and it reaches
 * months further back than they do — on the machine this was ported from, to
 * 2026-01-14 where the oldest surviving transcript is 2026-05-05. That turns
 * "we may have lost some data" into a number of sessions with dates.
 *
 * PROMPT TEXT IS DELIBERATELY NOT READ. `display` and `pastedContents` hold
 * what was typed, and a token counter has no business keeping that. Only the
 * id, the timestamp and the project are taken.

/**
 * Claude's Cowork — the Mac app's local agent mode.
 *
 * IT IS AN ORDINARY MAC APP AND ITS DATA IS STORED LIKE ONE. Application
 * Support, the way Apple tells every app to. What is inside is not a new
 * format at all: it is a tree of ordinary Claude Code profiles, three
 * directories down.
 *
 *   <config-base>/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/
 *       <accountUuid>/<orgUuid>/local_<uuid>/.claude/projects/<encoded>/<id>.jsonl
 *
 * So this reader is discovery only — it finds the nested `.claude/projects`
 * trees and hands the paths back. The counting is the Claude parser, unchanged,
 * because the files ARE Claude transcripts.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LOSE IT SILENTLY:
 *
 * 1. DEPTH. The nested `.claude` sits seven or eight levels below home. The
 *    ordinary profile walk stops at four, so nothing here is reachable by the
 *    normal discovery — it has to be walked deliberately.
 * 2. THE PROFILE RULE. These are profile-shaped directories with no
 *    `.claude.json` beside them, which is exactly the shape
 *    findConfigDirs refuses — the rule that excludes copied sandbox profiles.
 *    Cowork's are NOT copies, they are the app's own live store, so they are
 *    found here explicitly rather than by that walk. Loosening the general rule
 *    to admit them would have re-admitted the 489,464,459 tokens of sandbox
 *    copies it exists to keep out.
 *
 * Written on Linux, where this store cannot exist, so it reports `absent` here
 * and is unverified against real data. The paths are from the store layout, not
 * guessed; what a Mac run settles is the size of the number, not whether the
 * code is right.
