// The data receipt: everything this tool has retained about you, enumerated
// from the files themselves.
//
// "Nothing leaves your machine" is only half an answer, and it is the easier
// half. The kernel proof (PROVE-IT.md §1) closes egress — but a tool that never
// sends a byte can still READ your whole transcript and KEEP it in a file on
// your disk. And the scheduled run makes that sharper: a background scan prints
// its story to a log nobody reads, so "what you saw in the terminal" cannot
// police what it collected.
//
// So this walks ~/.starreckon — the complete set of everything starreckon retains
// — and reports the VOCABULARY of what is in there: every JSON key path, the
// longest free-text string anywhere, and the size and hash of every file. Not a
// promise that there is no transcript text; the actual list of what there is,
// derived from the bytes on disk, for you to read.
//
// Two properties make this worth trusting more than a sentence in a README:
//   - it reads the files, not the code. A build that started keeping prompt text
//     would show it here, because the string would be in the file.
//   - it covers daemon output too, so a background run is exactly as
//     accountable as one you watched.
