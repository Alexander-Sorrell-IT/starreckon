//
// findConfigDirs is accounts.mjs's discovery — by SHAPE (a directory whose

// a fixture, findConfigDirs(<empty temp dir>) returns the live
// /home/…/.claude-alt and its 1,212 transcripts: 9 tests' fixture totals wrong,

// ---- per-session export ----------------------------------------------------
//
// finalize() SUMS stats.sessions and then drops the Map, so every figure that
// leaves this process is a grand total. Five sum-preserving corruptions have
// already passed a differential built on grand totals — swap two sessions'
// tokens, move a session's tokens into its neighbour, move input into output,
// and every total still reconciles. A differential against the sibling program
// (deadreckon, which exports per-session records of its own) can only catch
// those if BOTH sides can be joined session by session, so this hands over the
// Map before it is thrown away.
//
// PER FIELD, NOT PER TOTAL. A single `total` per session hides a swap between
// two of the four counters — which is the one corruption class a token counter
// is most likely to actually have. The four field names are ledger.mjs's FIELDS,
// which were ported from deadreckon, so the two programs' records already agree
// on spelling and the join needs no translation table.
//
// MASKING. Every other file this program writes goes out masked, so this one
// does too, and the two fields that carry anything readable are handled here
// rather than left to the caller:
//
//   project — already reduced to a two-segment projectLabel() at scan time, and
//     the caller's forFiles()/maskProjects() swaps it for proj-<hash> under
//     --no-projects. Nothing more to do here; the key is literally `project`,
//     which is one of the shapes collectProjectLabels() looks for.
//
//   session_id — maskProjects CANNOT see this one, and it is not always a UUID.
//     When no row declared an id, parseClaudeFile falls back to
//     <parent-dir>/<file-stem>, and a Claude project directory name is the
//     user's working path with the slashes rewritten to dashes: the home dir,
//     the username and every project name, in one string. Writing that raw
//     would put into a NEW file exactly what maskPath() strips from every old
//     one, and under --no-projects it would leak the project names the flag
//     promises to hash — a privacy flag failing open, which is the defect class
//     cli-ux.test.mjs exists for. So:
//       * an id a ROW declared is emitted byte for byte. It is the join key,
//         the counting path uses it, and it is a vendor UUID, not a path.
//       * an id this scanner INVENTED from a path is masked (redactSecrets +
//         maskPath), and pseudonymised outright under --no-projects.
//     `id_source` says which of the two every record is, so the other side can
//     tell a joinable identity from this program's local fallback instead of
//     guessing from whether it sees a slash.
//
// The identity itself is NOT recomputed here: the key of stats.sessions is
// whatever parseClaudeFile last read out of d.sessionId (or the path fallback),
// which is the same identity every token in the record was credited under.
