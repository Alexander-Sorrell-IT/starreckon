// `starreckon series` — how much ordered history this machine holds, and what
// stands between it and a forecast band that would mean anything.
//
// IT DRAWS NO BAND, AND THAT IS THE FEATURE.
//
// deadreckon carries the time-series witness (forecast_check.py, the Cisco
// model): a second opinion that commits to a band BEFORE anyone knows the
// outcome, so it cannot be shaped by the result the way a test written after
// the fact can. starreckon has no witness at all. This command is not a
// half-built one — it reports the one fact that decides whether a witness here
// could ever mean anything: HOW MANY POINTS OF HISTORY EXIST.
//
// The bar is 10 and it is not ours to soften. It is a property of the model —
// its short contexts are trained only down to 10 points — and forecast_check.py
// refuses anything shorter outright, in its own words: "a band over nothing is
// worse than no band". Drawing a band over 8 points, or widening the interval
// to cover the shortfall, would be a check that cannot fail wearing 250M
// parameters. That is the failure mode this file exists to refuse, so nothing
// below predicts, scores, or gates: it prints counts and exits 0 either way.
//
// THREE ANSWERS, AND THEY ARE NEVER ONE ANSWER.
//
//   not enough yet   the history is 8 of 10. The data is short.
//   ran, nothing     the witness IS installed, it ran, and it recorded nothing.
//   not installed    there is no witness on this machine. Nothing ran, so
//                    "nothing was found" was never measured.
//
// Collapsing those is this project's signature defect — absent rendering
// exactly like zero — and it has cost this system 59,131 files, a 2.71x
// inflation and 4.07 billion orphaned tokens on separate occasions. The row
// states below carry the same split one level down: a series no snapshot has
// ever measured reports `no history`, never `0 of 10`.
//
// EVERY NUMBER IS COUNTED OFF THE FILES, ON EVERY RUN.
//
// Nothing here reads a stored count, a lifetime total or a `months_tracked`
// field. The reason is on the record: a Math.max over a stored record made
// corrections unreachable in ledger.mjs, and 16,636 sessions stood against a
// true 132 permanently because the stored number could only ever go up. A count
// that is re-derived at read time can be corrected by deleting a file; a stored
// one cannot be corrected at all.
//
// AND IT NEVER COMPUTES A VALUE. It counts POSITIONS — which months carry a
// measurement — and does no arithmetic on the measurements themselves. A view
// that sums nothing cannot be silently wrong about a sum, which is the shape of
// every scar this project has.
//
// WHY IT DOES NOT GO THROUGH loadTimeline(). Measured on a 3-month fixture whose
// oldest month predates two keys:
//
//     loadTimeline sessions     [1,2,3]     3 finite points
//     loadTimeline tool_calls   [0,2,3]     3 finite points   <- the 0 is a lie
//     loadTimeline night_hours  [null,2,3]  2 finite points
//
// loadTimeline() zero-fills its accumulator, so a month written before a field
// existed comes back as 0 — a fabricated point, indistinguishable from a month
// that genuinely measured zero, and exactly the thing you must not hand a
// forecaster as history. night_hours disagrees only because snapshots.mjs:212
// already had to fix that ONE field after 137.3 real night hours were drawn as
// 450,107. Every other field still has it. So the counting reads the raw
// records, where absent is absent.
