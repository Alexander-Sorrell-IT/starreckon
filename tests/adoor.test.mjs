// The [A] door tells the truth about which layers it will actually start.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR
//
// [D] hid itself when the daemon was unsupported or already installed. [A] —
// "models AND daemon in ONE press" — printed unconditionally and its consent
// screen announced the schedule files on every platform. On a machine with no
// schedule format the reader was shown "about to WRITE THE SCHEDULE FILES",
// answered "agree", and nothing was written. A consent screen exists so that
// nothing optional starts without saying truthfully what will happen; a screen
// that announces work it cannot do is the exact failure it was built to prevent.
//
// The same shape was live on [I] and on --with-models: the screen quoted a
// ~600 MB download to a reader whose models were already on disk.
//
// WHY THE RULE IS TESTED AS A PURE FUNCTION
//
// The unsupported-platform case cannot be reached end-to-end on a machine that
// IS supported, and inventing an env var that lies to the CLI about its own
// platform would be a production footgun shipped for a test's convenience. So
// the decision — which doors are offered, and what a door promises — is a pure
// function of measured layer states, and every state is exercised directly.
// The states themselves are measured in cli.mjs (existsSync + daemonStatus) and
// the already-installed half IS covered end-to-end below, because that state is
// one `daemon on` away on any supported platform.
