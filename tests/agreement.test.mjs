//
// They are two implementations of overlapping logic living in one process and
// writing into ONE json file, and every divergence found so far has been a bug
// that shipped:
//
//   - the local-clock day key landed in scan.mjs only, so a Chicago user
//     working 10:00 and 20:00 on a single day got active_days 1 from one half
//     and 2 from the other, in the same report, with the inflated number
//     feeding proficiency.consistency
//   - the model shape check landed in scan.mjs only, so `models` carried
//     `proj-<hash>` while `model_sessions` carried a raw filesystem path that
//     went on to the HTML page
//
// Neither was caught, because nothing compared the two halves. This file does.
// It is deliberately about AGREEMENT rather than values: if both are wrong in
// the same way that is a different test's job, but they must never contradict
// each other inside one document.
