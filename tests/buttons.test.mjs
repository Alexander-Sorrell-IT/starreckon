// Every button that WRITES, DELETES or OVERWRITES — asserted by the bytes.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// The before-you-go menu has fourteen keys. Seven of them had a test: [T], [E]
// (add and remove), [D], [I], [A], [G], [Q]. The seven that did not include
// every one that changes a file:
//
//   [R] reach out    writes ~/.starreckon/contact.json, and its [X] key
//                    DELETES the file outright
//   [C] compare      its [S] key writes ~/.starreckon/reports/compare-*.txt
//   [X] copy link    puts your name, email and phone on the clipboard
//   [Z] re-run       spawns a second full scan
//   [H] help         must print and STAY in the menu, not fall through to done
//
// And three file-writing FLAGS had no test at all: --sessions, --report, and
// the Desktop snapshot that every default run writes without any flag.
//
// The rule this file is written to: assert what the button DOES. An exit code
// is not a behaviour, and neither is a line of output claiming a file was
// saved. Every assertion below reads the filesystem after the keypress.
//
// Sandboxed HOME everywhere. Nothing here downloads, installs, or opens a
// socket; the one clipboard path is asserted through its FAILURE branch, which
// is what a machine with no clipboard tool actually takes.
