// tests/conformance.test.mjs — starreckon against hand-authored numbers.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER 600 TESTS
//
// Everything else in this suite asks whether starreckon is self-consistent.
// This asks whether it is RIGHT, against a tree a person built and totals a
// person worked out with a pencil — tests/conformance/EXPECTED.json carries the
// arithmetic beside every figure so it can be re-checked without running
// anything.
//
// The identical fixture and the identical EXPECTED.json live in deadreckon's
// repository, where its Python readers are held to the same numbers. That is
// the point of it: two programs, two languages, one set of literals that
// neither of them produced. Two ports can drift into agreeing with each other
// — five sum-preserving corruptions already passed 22 self-consistency checks
// in this project's history — and a shared, hand-authored oracle is the only
// thing that can tell them both they are wrong.
//
// IF A NUMBER HERE FAILS, THE CODE IS WRONG UNTIL SOMEBODY RE-DERIVES THE
// ARITHMETIC BY HAND. Editing EXPECTED.json to match the output converts this
// file into an expensive way of asserting that the code does what the code
// does.
