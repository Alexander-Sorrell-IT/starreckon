// COPY_DIRS is ONE list living in two repositories, and NOTHING compared them.
//
// src/accounts.mjs:71-82 and deadreckon's analyze_tokens.py:46-56 each carry a
// paragraph saying the two lists are the same list. They were not. They
// differed by exactly one name — this side had `token-corpus`, the other had
// `deadreckon-record` — and the missing name let starreckon's depth-4 home walk
// descend into ~/deadreckon-record, the preservation tree holding FIVE
// machines' archives: 59,131 transcript files counted as this computer's work,
// against 1,855 files in the live profiles.
//
// Both comments were then rewritten to say "it is the union now, both names in
// both programs". `grep -rln COPY_DIRS tests/` still returned NOTHING. The
// documented invariant had no test, in either repository, which is exactly the
// state it was in when it cost 59,131 files. This file is that missing test.
//
// It is in two halves on purpose:
//
//   1. THE PIN (always runs, anywhere). starreckon's live COPY_DIRS must equal
//      the list written out below. A stranger's checkout has no deadreckon
//      beside it, so this is the only half that can hold there — and it holds
//      the right thing: an edit to accounts.mjs alone fails here, and the
//      failure message is the instruction to go and edit the other program.
//
//   2. THE LIVE COMPARISON (runs when a deadreckon checkout is reachable).
//      Parses analyze_tokens.py's literal and demands set equality. The pin
//      catches a one-sided edit; only this catches the two lists having been
//      allowed to drift apart before either pin was written.
//
// Half 2 skips when deadreckon is not on the machine. That is a real hole and
// it is named rather than hidden: a skipped test prints `# skip` in the summary
// and half 1 still fails on any one-sided edit. The counterpart pin belongs in
// deadreckon's own suite, which is where a stranger's copy of THAT program gets
// the same protection — the same split tests/conformance.test.mjs already uses
// for EXPECTED.json ("two repositories cannot see each other's checkouts, so
// each pins the digest it was built against").

// git LFS. deadreckon-transcripts was in NEITHER list. It holds 0 .jsonl on
// this machine today — the LFS pointers have not been pulled — so it has cost
// nothing yet, which is the only reason adding it was cheap instead of another
// 59,131 files.
