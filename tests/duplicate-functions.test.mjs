// One name, two implementations, and nobody comparing them.
//
// Found by CROSS-REFERENCING two tools, not by either alone: mutation scored
// scan.mjs's computeStreaks at 0.0% across 36 mutants, and the reason nothing
// killed them is that tests/profile.test.mjs imports a computeStreaks from
// profile.mjs — a DIFFERENT function of the same name. The tests exercise one
// copy and the scan runs the other.
//
// The two had already drifted. Same machine, same data, two answers to "what is
// my current streak":
//
//   worked today and yesterday          scan 2   profile 2
//   worked YESTERDAY, not today         scan 2   profile 0
//   three days ending yesterday         scan 3   profile 0
//
// profile.mjs walks back from TODAY and returns 0 the moment today is not
// active; scan.mjs counts the run ending at the LAST ACTIVE DAY and only zeroes
// it if that was more than one day ago. Both are defensible products. Having
// both is not, and which one is right is the author's call.
//
// This test does not make that call. It asserts the CLASS: a name implemented
// twice must either be byte-identical, or be listed below with a reason. A
// duplicate that drifts silently is how the two answers happened.
