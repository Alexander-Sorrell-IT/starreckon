// requires the writer's real path to match it, so the sentence and the bytes
// are pinned to each other rather than to two people's memory.
//
// The rest are about the one rule the author was explicit on — a ledger at
// every level must be a VIEW of the run records, never a second counter. This
// project has already shipped a second counter that inflated a number 2.71x
// (src/accounts.mjs:443), so "it is a view" is asserted the only way that means
// anything: delete every ledger and require the next run to rebuild them
// identically, and inflate one by hand and require the next run to CORRECT it
// rather than add to it.
