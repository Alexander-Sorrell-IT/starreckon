// broken, both found on a real run, both pinned here.
//
//   1. writeSnapshots() assigned the current scan straight into
//      machines[host], REPLACING the stored month. One month re-scanned after
//      its logs rotated went 18,000,000 -> 3,600,000 input tokens, in a file
//      whose printed line says "lifetime only ever grows".
//   2. SNAP_DIR came from os.homedir(), which returns $HOME verbatim — and a
//      literal "~" in $HOME made the path "~/.starreckon/snapshots": mkdir
//      ENOENT on an npx run, or, where cwd was writable, a literal "~"
//      directory beside the caller that loadTimeline() never looks in.
