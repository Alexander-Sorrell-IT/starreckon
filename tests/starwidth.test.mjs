// The star follows the TERMINAL. The files it writes do not.
//
// A star that sizes itself to process.stdout.columns is an obvious win on a
// wide terminal and a silent disaster in a file: buildCompareReport() renders
// the same renderStar() frames into ~/.starreckon/reports/report-*.txt and the
// Desktop report.txt, and if the width came from the terminal then the CONTENT
// of those files would depend on which window happened to run the scan. Two
// machines holding an identical corpus would publish different bytes, which is
// exactly what tests/determinism.test.mjs exists to prevent — and it would not
// catch this one, because it runs both halves of its comparison in the same
// process, with the same stdout.
//
// So the width is an explicit option with a pinned default, the terminal is
// read ONLY at the call sites that print to a terminal, and the last test here
// is the one that matters: file output is a function of the corpus alone.
