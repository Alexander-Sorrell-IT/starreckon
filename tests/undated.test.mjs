// A session counted in one figure and invisible in another, with nothing on

//
// finalize() files every session into the month it STARTED in — but only
// `if (isFinite(s.firstTs))`. A session with no usable date still counts in
// total_sessions and still adds its tokens to the grand totals; it lands in no
// monthly bucket, so it is in no month's star, no snapshot and no lifetime
// figure derived from the timeline. The same hole exists one layer out: the
// ported readers emit sessions with `start: null` on purpose (a vanished
// session has no turn to take a date from), and those carry real tokens into
// the every-CLI total and into no month at all.
//
// Neither hole was reported anywhere. These tests fix the count in place, and
// the invariant test is the one that matters: total_sessions is exactly the
// dated sessions plus the undated ones, so the two views can be reconciled by
// anyone holding the report instead of by reading this file.

// TAKEN FROM BOB, with the premise measured first.
//
// Everything above counts a session that REACHED stats.sessions with no usable
// start. Both parsers drop a row whose timestamp will not parse before
// session() is ever called, so on the corpus side that count is structurally
// zero and the field says nothing about this machine.
//
// The row that was dropped is the interesting one. A transcript row can declare
// a sessionId, carry a full usage block, and have a timestamp that will not
// parse — a half-written line from a killed process, a clock that came back
// wrong. Today that row is discarded whole, tokens and all, and NOTHING says
// so: total_sessions does not count it, no month contains it, no error is
// printed. Measured before adopting this: a fabricated broken-clock row took
// 999,999 input tokens and an entire session out of the scan silently.
//
// The false-positive risk was measured too, because a number that reads
// non-zero for boring reasons is worse than no number. Over 246 real transcript
// files (132,614 rows, 131 distinct sessions): 22,281 rows do declare a
// sessionId with no usable timestamp — and every one of those sessions ALSO has
// dated rows, so ids appearing ONLY on undated rows came to 0, and none of the
// undated rows carried a usage block at all. This counts sessions, not rows,
// and a session with even one dated row is not undated.
